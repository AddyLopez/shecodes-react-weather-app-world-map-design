**_Learning objective:_** To build a weather application integrated with the OpenWeatherMap API using React. This application is capable of showing the weather for over 200,000 cities around the world. Original, experimental world-map design features integration with React Leaflet.

## Project Previews

Featuring multiple map tile layers with zoom capabilities, current weather and forecast data in metric or imperial units, and "fly to" animation for searches around the world!
